# AppStoreClone

This app is a clone of the App Store using iTunes search API

This app allows the user to enter a search term to look for an app. It returns a list of apps that match the search term. When the user tabs on the result, it displays the app on a separate page, including the apps details, opening, add icon, description, screenshots, price, size, version, etc. It also allows the user to filter the search results by category and whether the app is free or paid.

This app was created on Xcode using swift and Apple frameworks.
